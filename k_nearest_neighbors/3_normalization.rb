# TODO: change the iris dataset (or find another one) to include heterogenous
# measurements. for instance, if one measurement was in mm instead of cm (or
# more likely, if one measurement was in celsius etc).
#
# in this case the mm measurement will overwhelm the remaining values, causing
# lower accuracy.
#
# before calculating distance, normalize all values to a range from 0..1
